    Last year, Jarod left a job that pays \$60,000 to run his own bike-repair shop. Jarod’s shop charges \$65 for a repair, and last year the shop performed 3,000 repairs. Jarod’s production costs for the year included rent, wages, and equipment. Jarod spent \$50,000 on rent and \$100,000 on wages for his employees. Jarod keeps whatever profit the shop earns, but does not pay himself an official wage. Jarod used \$20,000 of his savings to buy a machine for the business. His savings were earning an annual interest rate of 5 percent.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is Jarod's annual accounting profit?

        \begin{itemize}
            \item sets in because not all workers are equally productive

    Alicia Gregory owns a foot massage business. She leases 4 computer-controlled massage booths, for which she pays \$125 per day. She cannot increase the number of machines she leases without giving the manufacturer 3 months notice. She can hire as many workers as she wants at a cost of \$75 per day per worker. These are the only two inputs she uses in her business. Use this information to fill in the columns in the above table.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Diminishing marginal returns happens in the short run when you have at least one fixed factor of production and describes why marginal cost increases after a point
            \item Diseconomies of scale happens in the long run when all factors of production are variable, and describes why average cost increases after a point.

    Consider a firm that increases its inputs by 15 percent. For each scenario, state whether the firm experiences economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, or constant returns to scale.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Outputs increase 15 percent.
        \item Outputs increase by less than 15 percent.
        \item Outputs increase by greater than 15 percent.

    Elegant Settings manufactures stainless steel cutlery.

        \item Elegant Settings experiences economies of scale at an output of \underline{\phantom{3000}} or less and diseconomies of scale at an output level above \underline{\phantom{4000}}.

        \item Over what range of output does it experience constant returns to scale?
